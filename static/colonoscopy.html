                        <p><b>What to expect: </b>An intravenous line (IV) will be started to administer medications. Patients are given a combination of a sedative (to help patients relax) and a narcotic (to prevent discomfort). Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, and blood oxygen level) will be monitored before, during, and after examination.</p>
                        <p><b>The Procedure: </b>The procedure typically takes between 15-20 minutes. The colonoscopy is performed while the patient lies on their left side. The colonoscope is a flexible tube, approximately the width of an index finger. The scope has a lens and light source that allows Dr. Lin to look into the scope or a TV monitor. The endoscope contains channels that allow Dr. Lin to obtain biopsies, remove polyps and to introduce or withdraw fluid or air. Air is introduced through the scope to open up the colon so that the scope can be moved forward and to allow Dr. Lin to see. Patients may experience a sensation of bloating or gas cramps from the air as it distends the colon.</p>
                        <p><b>Recovery: </b>After the colonoscopy, patients will be observed for 1-2 hours while the sedative medication wears off. The medication can cause most patients to temporarily feel tired or have difficulty concentrating. Patients should not drive or return to work after the procedure. The most common discomfort after the exam is a feeling of bloating and gas cramps. Most patients are able to eat a regular diet after the exam. Patients should ask about when it is safe to restart aspirin or blood thinning medications prior to being discharged.</p>
