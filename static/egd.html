                <h3><b>An upper endoscopy, often referred to as EGD or esophagogastroduodenoscopy, is a procedure that allows a physician to directly examine the upper part of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum (the first section of the small intestine).</b></h3>

                        <p><b>What to expect: </b>An intravenous line will be started to administer medications. Patients are given a combination of a sedative (to help patients relax) and a narcotic (to prevent discomfort). Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, and blood oxygen level) will be monitored before, during, and after examination.</p>
                        <p><b>The Procedure: </b>The procedure typically takes between 10-20 minutes to complete. The endoscopy is performed while the patient lies on their left side. Dr. Lin will give medication to numb the throat and a plastic mouth guard is placed between the teeth to prevent damage to the teeth and scope. The endoscope is a flexible tube that is about the width of a finger. The scope has a lens and light source that allows Dr. Lin to look into the scope to see the inner lining of the upper gastrointestinal tract, or to view it on a TV monitor. Dr. Lin may take tissue samples called biopsies (not painful), or perform specific treatments (such as dilation, removal of polyps, treatment of bleeding).</p>
                        <p><b>Recovery: </b>After the EGD, patients will be observed for 1-2 hours while the sedative medication wears off. The medication can cause most patients to temporarily feel tired or have difficulty concentrating. Patients should not drive or return to work after the procedure. The most common discomfort after the exam is a mild sore throat. Most patients are able to eat shortly after the procedure.</p>
