                        <p><b>What to expect: </b>You might be given a sedative or have a local anesthetic applied to your throat to make you more comfortable. Some patients also receive antibiotics prior to the procedure.</p>
                        <p><b>The Procedure: </b>The ERCP is performed while the patient lies on their left side. The endoscope is a thin, flexible tube that lets Dr. Lin see inside the bowels. Dr. Lin will pass an endoscope through the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and into the duodenum (first part of the small intestine). After viewing the common opening to ducts from the liver and pancreas, Dr. Lin will inject a contrast material (dye) into the pancreatic or biliary ducts and will take x-rays. The instrument does not interfere with breathing, but you might feel a bloating sensation because of the air introduced through the instrument.</p>
                        <p><b>What are possible complications of ERCP? </b>ERCP is a well-tolerated procedure when performed by doctors who are specially trained and experienced in the technique. Although complications requiring hospitalization can occur, they are uncommon. Complications can include pancreatitis (an inflammation or infection of the pancreas), infections, bowel perforation, and bleeding. Some patients can have an adverse reaction to the sedative used. Complications are often managed without surgery. Risks vary, depending on why the test is performed, what is found during the procedure, what therapeutic intervention is undertaken, and whether a patient has major medical problems. Patients undergoing therapeutic ERCP, such as for stone removal, face a higher risk of complications than patients undergoing diagnostic ERCP.</p>
